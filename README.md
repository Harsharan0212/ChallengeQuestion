# ChallengeQuestion
### Question:
Write a python program to sort the list of heterogeneous data.
### Approach:
To sort hetrogeneous data in a list we first need to convert it to same data type i.e. either string or int or float. 
In this question, I have converted the entire list in string and sorted it.
